Feedback:
The code didnâ€™t demonstrate many of the language features, like DI, interfaces, inheritance or polymorphism. 
 
As a result code quality was lacking and could have been significantly cleaner and logically grouped by responsibility for a modular future-proof and reusable design (ie polygon class, triangle class, square/rect class, base shape class, string parser etc). 

Doesn't contain unit tests (a requirement for any production ready app).
